In order to run the simulation, you should run CellWorld.java. This is the class that starts the animation
timeline in the CellViewer.  One can load different XML files by clicking on the ... button in the File Explorer
bar on the top of the GUI.  We support the 4 originally specified models, namely, Game Of Life, Segregation,
Shark(Predator) & Fish(Prey), and the Fire Simulation.  In addition, we have support for SugarScape, which is a part of 
the second set of implementation specifications.  You can dynamically interact with the simulations by 
clicking on the cells which toggles their state.  We have implemented error checking. cellShape and gridBoundaryType
are the two parameters that go together.  We assign default values for these two items where nothing is specified.
The button functions should be self-explanatory in nature and responsive to user interaction.
